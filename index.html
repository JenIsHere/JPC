        <p class="generalText">This project is created in order to develop the necessary skillsets in Web GIS Development as well as creating an appealing webpage. Team JPC will implement the acquired knowledge of open-source software such as Leaflet and Mapbox to create a solution. This knowledge will be put to further use for Collaborative Project during the Spring 2022 term.</p>

        <p class="generalText"> The Ontario Headwaters Institute works to protect Ontarioâ€™s watersheds, their natural heritage, and receiving waters such as the Great Lakes. Under A Place to Grow:Growth Plan, municipalities of the Greater Golden Horseshoe area required to update their development and landuse plans to account for population growth through 2051. The current situation suggests that the municipalities could opt to expand their urban boundaries at the expense of agricultural lands of the Whitebelt. For this project, the OHI would like the JPC team to create a tool to raise public awareness regarding the imminent loss of natural heritage. </p>
