        <!-- <h2>The Study Area</h2>
        <p>As per <b>A Place to Grow: Growth Plan</b>, the municipalities of Greater Golden Horseshoe are required to provide their development plans through 2051 by the end of June 2022.</p>
        <p>The study area of interest to our the OHI was identified to be the municipalities within the Golden Horseshoe (GH) region.</p>
        <p>Upon further discussions, the key area of interest within the GH was the "Contested Countryside"</p>
        <p>The Contested Countryside is the lands that fall between the existing urban development boundaries from the south and the interior Greenbelt Boundaries</p>
        <p>The map visualizes boundaries of the municipalities that govern within this region as well as the Greenbelt.</p>
        <p>Navigate through the tabs above to view the results of a Site Suitability Analysis which details the lands at risk in the Contested Country side, as well as the lands most suitable for increased development within the existing urban boundaries.</p>
        <br> -->
        <h3>What is the Contested Countryside and Why is it Important?</h3>
        <p>A Place to Grow: Growth plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, requires upper and lower tier municipalities across the region to submit new draft official plans for approval by the Province by July 2, 2022, and for these draft plans to address projected population and density targets to 2051.</p>
        <p>Some municipalities have decided to pursue more intensive urban development within existing boundaries, with very little expansion of those boundaries into adjacent natural and agricultural land, while others have proposed massive urban expansion, usually with less density. The proposed expansion of urban boundaries would occur in the Contested Countryside, lands that fall between the existing urban boundaries and the boundary of the Greenbelt.</p>
        <p>Urban expansion into the Contested Countryside, sometimes call the white belt, could threaten water and hydrologic integrity, regional biodiversity, natural areas that can bolster climate resilience, and local food security while lower densities amount to sprawl with no ability to provide mass transit at reasonable costs.</p>
        <p>The mapping done in this project demonstrates key aspects of the Contested Countryside and suggests three development scenarios to inform public discussion as municipalities move from the new official plans to more detailed plans between now and 2051.</p>
