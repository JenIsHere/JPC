    <p class="generalText">In order to complete our collaborative project, Team JPC recognizes four key components to implement an effective solution and to meet identified deliverables. Team JPC's methodology is expanded upon in the topics below.</p>

<div class="grid">
  <div class="gridcontent">
    <h1 class="homeSubHead">Data acquisition & Data pre-processing</h1>
    <p class="generalText">The initial phase of the project included the collection of data to guide the spatial analysis as well as ensure a visually pleasing cartographic output. The data JPC acquired and incorporated into the final deliverables came from a wide variety of sources including the Ontario GeoHub, Statistics Canada, Topographic Data of Canada - CanVec Series as well as the European Space Agency. </p>

<div class="grid2">
  <div class="gridcontent">
    <h1 class="homeSubHead">Spatial Analysis</h1>
    <p class="generalText">The Spatial Analysis conducted was a key factor in the deliverables. Three scenarios were defined: the Urban Development Approach, the Conservation Approach and the Balanced Approach each treated as their own Site Suitability Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis.</p>
    <p class="generalText">JPC defined effective criteria in which to base our analysis. This included categorizing existing lands based on current land use, land classifications as well as topological features and existing demographic indicators. Each of these criteria were rated from 1 (least suitable) through 9 (most suitable) for urban development under each of the three approaches. With the criteria established the next step was to generate the AHP pairwise comparisons between each criterion to derive their level of importance.</p>
    <p class="generalText">With the ratings for each criteria and the pairwise comparison weightings defined, JPC utilized ArcGIS Pro to build models and  execute the analysis generating cost surfaces for each criterion and final weighted surfaces under each approach.</p>

<div class="grid">
  <div class="gridcontent">
    <h1 class="homeSubHead">Interactive Web Map</h1>
    <p class="generalText">To display the results on a web map, the team first needed to create a base map including key data layers would be visually appealing as well as help incorporate our analysis results. Through the use of MapBox styles and GeoJSON, With cartographic principles in mind, an attractive style was generated and further utilized to displays the results for each of the final weighted surfaces.</p>    
    <p class="generalText">Utilizing GitHub, HTML, CSS and MapBox GL JS, an interactive web map was created. The aforementioned styles were incorporated with the proper rendering properties, a sidebar for supplementary test, a legend and full navigation controls; all to the benefit of enabling our analysis results in telling their story.</p>
